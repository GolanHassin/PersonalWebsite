I also <strong>tested</strong> and <strong>debugged</strong> to ensure the game ran smooth. <p></p> <img src="./Video%20Poker.486f51e1.jpg" class="center" width="500" height="200"> <br> <br> <h3>‚ÄúAmazin‚Äù Web Store Front</h3> https://github.com/SYSC4806-Group13/SYSC4806-Project <p> This is group project to replicate a small book store. <br> The project was built in <strong>Java</strong> it is a virtual bookstore complete with search, filter, checkout and other standard online webstore functionalities. <strong>React, REST, Springboot</strong> and more are used to make the bookstore possible </p> <img src="./Amazin.75eb73b2.jpg" width="500" height="200"> <p> <br> </p><h3>Risk board game</h3> I worked on a team of four engineering students to design and implement a GUI for the board game RISK, using <strong>Java</strong> and important problem-solving skills. An MVC pattern was used to desing and build the project. <br> The user has all the functionality that any user playing Risk would have. This includes fortifying, conquest, pasing and even playing versus AI. <p></p> <img src="./Risk.90994e62.jpg" width="500" height="200"> </section> <section> <h2>üéì Education</h2> <p> </p><h3>Carleton University, Ottawa, Ontario</h3> Software Engineering (BEng) <br> Completed degree <br> Graduated: April 2023 <br> CGPA: 9.69 <br> <br> <h3>Lisgar Collegiate Institute, Ottawa, Ontario</h3> Ontario Secondary School Diploma, September 2014- June 2018 <br> Graduated with a Silver Medal <br> Certified Bilingual by earning: Dipl√¥me d‚Äô√©tudes en langue fran√ßaise (DELF), level B2 <p></p> </section> <section class="left"> <h2>üëî Work History</h2> <p style="display:inline-block"> <img src="./Leonardo.edc58d1e.jpg" width="50" height="50"> <strong class="tab4"> &emsp; Leonardo DRS</strong> </p> <p> Junior Software Engineer <br> January 2021 ‚Äì December 2021, May 2022 - August 2022 <br> <br> The main tasks consisted of taking functionality from legacy software that supported the use of a flight recorder(black box) and intergrating it with the current compnay framework. <br> <br> Legacy software was written in <b>C++</b> and the functionality, such as downloading data, then had to be written in <b>Java</b> to intergate the with modern product that was to be shipped ot customers. The job also required using <strong>Git/Github, Jira and Confluence</strong> to update the work. <br> <br> In both my terms with Leonardo I trained new Co-op students and helped them integrate with the company environemnt, and get up to speed with the different technologies being used. Finally, I also tested the software on physical hardware pieces in the lab. </p> <p style="display:inline-block"> <img src="./Chess.com.a9a94286.jpeg" width="50" height="50"> <strong class="tab4"> &emsp; Chess.com</strong> </p> <p> Tester <br> May 2019 - August 2019 <br> I searched and tested for flaws or bugs in the Chess.com analysis mode on IOS and Windows devices. The testing was conducted based on deadlines and requirements from the team to meet live product release dates. And I openly discussed and submitted testing results with the supervisors via a Slack group. <br> </p> <h3></h3> <p> </p> </section> <blockquote> <p>Thanks for reading!</p> </blockquote> </main> <script type="module" src="./index.1502adf2.js"></script> </body></html>
